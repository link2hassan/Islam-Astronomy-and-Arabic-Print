## Islam, Astronomy, and Arabic Print: A collection showcase at Middle Temple Library

This exhibition was born out of an idea to showcase some of Middle Temple Library’s lesser-known printed and manuscript codicies that embody the presence of the Arabic and Islamic worlds across Europe between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It tells the story of the emergence of Arabic print culture that flourished in the printing houses of London and Oxford nearly a century after Gutenberg’s revolutionary press. It goes onto explore the interest in the Quran across major European cities during this epoch of wider fascination into Islamic scholarship. And ends by looking at the impact of Islamic astronomy on writers and thinking in England during a period of dramatic growth in scientific and religious understanding of the universe.

## ‘ſpeciall VVords of the Eastern Tongues’: Arabic print in Renaissance London

Printing and the printing of books across Europe has a well-established history. Less known, however, is the growth of Arabic printing in England, whose own story has its roots in the publishing houses of sixteenth-century London and at the University of Oxford. In this display case, and the one next to it, are a collection of books that highlight the development of Arabic moveable type in and around London between 1524 and 1648.

## 1524: VVakefield and early Arabic type

While there exists no specific date as to when Arabic printing took seed in England, the publication of Robert Wakefield’s Oratio de laudibus & vtilitate trium linguarum marked an important moment in this story. Printed in 1524 by Wynkyn de Worde of Fleet Street, Wakefield’s title – a Latin treatise on the merits of Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew – is considered the first work in England to contain the presence of Arabic type.

The Arabic characters that appear towards the end of the book demonstrates the early, frustrated relationship between the infancy of moveable type in Europe – which, in 1524, had been introduced only 74-years prior with the establishment of Gutenberg’s press – and the calligraphic complexity and artistry of Arabic script. The few Arabic character that are included in the book are misshapen and lack the necessary cursive nature of elegant, flowing writing.

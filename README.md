## Islam, Astronomy, and Arabic Print: A collection showcase at Middle Temple Library

This exhibition was born out of an idea to showcase some of Middle Temple Library’s lesser-known printed and manuscript codicies that embody the presence of the Arabic and Islamic worlds across Europe between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It tells the story of the emergence of Arabic print culture that flourished in the printing houses of London and Oxford nearly a century after Gutenberg’s revolutionary press. It goes onto explore the interest in the Quran across major European cities during this epoch of wider fascination into Islamic scholarship. And ends by looking at the impact of Islamic astronomy on writers and thinking in England during a period of dramatic growth in scientific and religious understanding of the universe.

## ‘ſpeciall VVords of the Eastern Tongues’: Arabic print in Renaissance London

Printing and the printing of books across Europe has a well-established history. Less known, however, is the growth of Arabic printing in England, whose own story has its roots in the publishing houses of sixteenth-century London and at the University of Oxford. In this display case, and the one next to it, are a collection of books that highlight the development of Arabic moveable type in and around London between 1524 and 1648.

## 1524: VVakefield and early Arabic type

While there exists no specific date as to when Arabic printing took seed in England, the publication of Robert Wakefield’s Oratio de laudibus & vtilitate trium linguarum marked an important moment in this story. Printed in 1524 by Wynkyn de Worde of Fleet Street, Wakefield’s title – a Latin treatise on the merits of Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew – is considered the first work in England to contain the presence of Arabic type.
<br><br>
The Arabic characters that appear towards the end of the book demonstrates the early, frustrated relationship between the infancy of moveable type in Europe – which, in 1524, had been introduced only 74-years prior with the establishment of Gutenberg’s press – and the calligraphic complexity and artistry of Arabic script. The few Arabic character that are included in the book are misshapen and lack the necessary cursive nature of elegant, flowing writing.

## 1592: A dream in Venice, Paris, London 

irst published in Venice in 1499, Francesco Colonna’s poem tells the story of the dream of Poliphilo, whose unrequited love for the beautiful Polia causes him unrelenting insomnia. When he finally falls asleep, he seemingly awakes in a darkened wood where his adventure begins. Arguably one of the most beautiful books of the Venetian Renaissance, it has also been deemed unreadable. The narrative is composed in Latinate Italian (Italian syntax with a Latin vocabulary).
<br><br>
It is believed to have been the first book, published in Europe, to contain Arabic print.  Middle Temple Library holds within its collection a 1561 edition, translated from Italian into French. There exist noticeable differences between the Arabic script incorporated into both the first and Paris editions. The first image displayed (above) includes Greek and Arabic, which roughly translates to ‘Labour and Industry’. The artistry of both designs is also apparent: the 1499 edition is far simpler than its French counterpart, where the border around both inscriptions is heavily patterned with coiling leaves and intricate lattice work.
<br><br>
The second woodcut illustration in the Paris edition appears far more detailed than those in the original – the rocks include depth and shading, and the Arabic inscription above the doors is more cursive in quality and more faithful to the flowing nature of the script. The inscription – carved into the rocks in Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic – translates to: “gloria dei; mater amoris; gloria mundi” (the glory of God; mother of love; glory of the world). The French edition of 1561 at Middle Temple Library is an item that embodies a profusion of cultures and languages, merging East and West. Published in France, based on a story published in Venice, retold from stories of the Classical world, incorporating Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, and, in 1592, English.

## 1614 and 1635: John Selden, the Inns of Court, and Arabic type

The early modern jurist and scholar of England’s ancient laws, John Selden (1584-1654), is a towering figure in the cobbled history of the Inns of Court. A member of Inner of Temple, called in 1612, outside his legal career, Selden was an avid bibliophile who amassed a great number of books in Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin. He was contemporaries with similarly well-connected collectors of books and manuscripts such as Sir Robert Cotton, whose own library was one of the founding collections of the British Museum Library (now the British Library headquartered at St Pancras).
<br><br>
In 1614, Selden’s Titles of Honor – a monumental work devoted to peerage law, heraldry, and genealogy – was published. It included several Turkish and Arabic words, which are indexed at the end of the book in a section titled ‘the more special vvords of the Eastern Tongues, to our purpose herein interpreted’.

## 

Some twenty-one years after the publication of Titles of Honor, Selden’s Mare Clausum was published. Its thesis supported the legal doctrine of a country’s ownership and dominion of the waters contiguous to its coastline. Middle Temple Library owns a 1635 edition, published in London, which uses a combination of Hebraic script and blackletter Gothic.<br><br><br><br>
In 1636, a new edition was published in Leiden – Lvgdvni Batavorvm – which, as an established centre of printing in its own right, had begun experimenting with Arabic metal type.
<br><br>
Both the Titles and the 1636 Leiden edition of Mare include typeset Arabic characters that are somewhat disjointed and contain a number of large gaps where the printer has attempted to provide enough room to fit the Arabic script neatly alongside the Latin print.

## 1642: The first printed Arabic book in England

Having published two titles containing Arabic script, John Selden went on to publish a fourth, after De iure naturali & gentium, titled Eutychii Aegyptii, which consisted of Arabic text with juxtaposed Latin translation of a portion of the church history of Sa’id ibn Batriq (one of the first Christian Egyptian writers to use the Arabic language. His writings include the chronicle Nazm al-Jauhar (“Row of Jewels”), also known by its Latin title Eutychii Annales (“The Annals of Eutychius”)).
<br><br>
Its Arabic content was much more substantial than the previous items, and is, therefore, considered in many scholarly circles the first Arabic book printed in England.

## 1648: Post-English Civil War and the boom in Arabic printing

Despite the initial issues in 1639, both in terms of printing technicality as well as the outbreak of the English Civil War in the 1640s, which had an adverse effect on learned activity in English universities, these problems began to improve from 1648 onwards. Arabic printing efforts were being propelled by the likes of John Greaves (1602-1652) and Edward Pococke (1604-1691). The latter was better known as a scholar; the former took the lead in the matter of Arabic printing.
<br><br>
John Greaves, Savillian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford, borrowed the university’s matrices, originally procured by Oxford’s William Laud from the Leiden-based printed, Arent an Hoogenacker, and volunteered to have their defects – as explored above in the writings of Wakefield and Selden – remedied. In doing so, Greaves went on to publish a text of the writings of Persian astronomer, Mīrzā Muhammad Tāraghay bin Shāhrukh (known also as Ulugh Beg, 1394-1449): The Canicularia.


## Reading the stars: English printing and Persian astronomy 

Ulugh Beg was an astronomer, scientist, and ruler who established the famous observatory in Samarkand in the 15th century. His writings were read by John Greaves who went on to publish them in the Canicularia, printed in Latin with a significant amount of Greek and occasional phrases in Arabic and Hebrew. It is probably the first Arabic-script printing in Oxford, and the first Persian text to be printed in England.
